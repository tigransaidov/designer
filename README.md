# designer
UI & UX Designer Website, converted from PSD ho HTML. 
With modals and state messages. 
State Messages showing error or successful action after submiting a form. 
Adaptive code with laptop, tablet and phone version.
With Animations, Works-Filter by category, Slider made with Slick JS and Mobile Nav-Menu. 

================= // =======================

Things, which I couldn't fix:
- Even when state message is opened and you try to flip phone to tablet orientation the message looks wrong(need to fix orientation, if this bug still exists I didn't find a solution). 
- Buttons that showing after scrolling a page have no hover. Hover doesn't work because of showing animation. I tried many solutions but they're not working.
